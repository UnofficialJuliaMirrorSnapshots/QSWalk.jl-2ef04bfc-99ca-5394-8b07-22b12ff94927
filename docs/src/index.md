## Welcome to QSWalk.jl

*QSWalk.jl* is a package providing an implementation of open continuous-time quantum walk based on the GKSL master equation. In particular, it provides the implementation of functions useful for analyzing the local interaction, the global interaction, and the non-moralizing global interaction stochastic quantum walk models.

Package repository contains [examples](https://github.com/iitis/QSWalk.jl/) presenting the most of the functionality of the package. Examples are provided as `.ipynb`, as well as `.jl` files. The detailed description of the package can also be found in [manuscript available from arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01294).


 Description of the quantum stochastic models can be found in the following papers:
